Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Music Emotion Recognition, ISMIR 2022 [paper]
Angelo Cesar Mendes da Silva, Diego Furtado Silva and Ricardo Marcondes Marcacini

- We learn a new multimodal representation to music data composed by audio and lyrics features
- This representation is applied on a new model to music emotion classification based on heterogeneous graph neural network
- It represents a new approach to modelling music data as graph structure
- Our representation can be enriched with others modalities
